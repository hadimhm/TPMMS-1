# TPMMS
This is a custom implementation of the TPMMS(http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/554/Syllabus/4-query-exec/2-pass=TPMMS.html) algorithm for the COMP5 6521 corse at Concordia University in Winter 2019, taught by Professor Shiri.
It is tailored to a very specific data format, although it is generelisable to support templated data.

For a very concise and comprehensible implemention of this algorithm, one can refer to this link: https://github.com/arq5x/kway-mergesort
